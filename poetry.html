         <center><div class="polaroid">Set me where as the sun doth parch the green, 
Or where his beams do not dissolve the ice; 
In temperate heat where he is felt and seen; 
With proud people, in presence sad and wise; 
Set me in base, or yet in high degree, 
In the long night, or in the shortest day, 
In clear weather, or where mists thickest be, 
In lost youth, or when my hairs be grey; 
Set me in earth, in heaven, or yet in hell, 
In hill, in dale, or in the foaming flood; 
Thrall, or at large, alive where so I dwell, 
Sick, or in health, in ill fame or good: 
Yours will I be, and with that only thought 
Comfort myself when that my hope is nought.  <br/>â€“ Henry Howard</div></center>
